changelog: Update compare picks to ensure no numpy obj saves are attempted
description: A solution that compares the picks from a reference user and session
  to a candidate user and session for all particle types, providing metrics like average
  distance, precision, recall, and F-beta score. Computes micro-averaged F-beta score
  across all runs if run_name is not provided.
